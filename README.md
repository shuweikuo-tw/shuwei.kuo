Heya, I am Shu Wei, a frontend developer(for now),  
I self-taught myself the web development field and luckily I got an opportunity contributes to my first web development job  
And now it's 3rd year of my second front end engineer in D-Link.  
What has not changed for these years is my passion on the curiosity of learning new things,  
and programming nevert got old(it changes, grows so fast)
